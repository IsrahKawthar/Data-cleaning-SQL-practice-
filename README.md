# SQL Data Cleaning Project

## Project Description
A hands-on data cleaning project using SQL. This repository documents my process of following along with the ["Data Cleaning in MySQL | Full Project"](https://youtu.be/4UltKCnnnTA?feature=shared) tutorial by Alex The Analyst on YouTube. The goal was to learn and practice my SQL skills, specifically focusing on preparing raw data for analysis.

**Disclaimer:** This is a **learning project**. The original data and project concept are from Alex The Analyst's GitHub. All credit for the data and project goes to him.

## Data Source
The raw data (`layoffs.csv`) was sourced from Alex The Analyst's GitHub repository:
